I like his sire and he has left his stamp on this colt who is physically gorgeous, sound, strong, a good mover and has an excellent temperament. This fellow made a very pleasing debut at Haydock in May and it did him the power of good. He came forward for that and I expected a big run last week at Doncaster, when he did not disappoint with a 4L win. Potentially he could be anything as our juveniles usually come on a lot for their initial efforts. The plan immediately after that was the Superlative Stakes this week but I spoke to his owner afterwards and he is a very patient man with his horses and suggested we may wait a little longer, in which case the Listed Pat Eddery Stakes at Ascot on 24 July would be the target. This son of Churchill has always looked a cut above my others and the lads that have ridden him at home have all said he feels like a proper horse. I think he has a very bright future and could be anything. I know it is early days but he could be very smart indeed. 07-07-21"}],"number":11,"draw":6,"headgear":"t","headgear_first":"","lbs":120,"ofr":83,"rpr":112,"ts":null,"jockey":"K C
